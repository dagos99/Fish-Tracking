## Project Overview

This project delves into the challenges of fish detection and classification by harnessing the power of deep learning techniques. The primary objectives are twofold:

1. **Fish Detection using YOLO:** Utilizing the You Only Look Once (YOLO) framework, the project offers a robust solution for real-time object tracking, enabling accurate and efficient fish detection in video footage.

2. **Species Classification:** By capturing multiple snapshots of detected fishes, the project employs a novel classification method. It aggregates predictions across these images, determining the species based on the majority vote, ensuring high accuracy and reliability.

3. **DeepLabCut for Trajectory Analysis:** In a pioneering exploration, the project uses DeepLabCut to analyze the trajectory of fish body parts. This method opens new avenues for understanding fish behavior and movement patterns, contributing valuable insights for species classification.
